It turned out to be a complex, obscure vulnerability that ignited a conversation surrounding the security of api.wordpress.org and what could happen if the servers were compromised.</p>\n<p>One idea that was brought forth is to digitally sign WordPress core, theme, and plugin updates. For at least five years, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25052">a trac ticket</a> has laid semi-dormant with this idea in mind.</p>\n<p>Fifteen months ago, Scott Arciszewski, Chief Development Officer for Paragon Initiative Enterprises, who is most widely known for his <a href="https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/02/cryptographically-secure-php-development">cryptography engineering work</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214062414/https://medium.com/@CiPHPerCoder/stopmullware-on-the-security-of-27-of-the-websites-on-the-internet-298a7e5b6871">published an article</a> that has since been taken down, expressing his strong desire for Matt Mullenweg to make secure cryptographic signatures a priority. Mullenweg responded to his post with <a href="https://medium.com/@photomatt/wordpress-and-update-signing-51501213e1">one of his own</a> stating that although WordPress update signing is important, it&#8217;s not a high priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will at some point; as said above it’s a good idea — can’t hurt, might help,&#8221; Mullenweg responded when asked if WordPress was ever going to do update signing. &#8220;There are, however, some more important security issues in front of it, that impact millions of sites in the real world, so we are prioritizing those issues above a nice-to-have, defense in-depth effort.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Eric Mann Launches Secure WordPress Updates Plugin</h2>\n<p>While WordPress does not digitally sign updates, Eric Mann, founder of <a href="https://displace.tech/">Displace Technologies, LLC</a>, has <a href="https://ttmm.io/tech/introducing-secure-updates-for-wordpress/">created and released</a> a new plugin that adds code signing to WordPress core updates. It&#8217;s called DGXPCO or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/dgxpco/">Digital Guarantees for eXplicitly Permitted Core Operations</a>. You&#8217;ll find it on the plugin directory by searching for DGXPCO.</p>\n<p>When installed and activated, the plugin integrates with the core updater and requires that any core update must have a valid signature before it can be installed. The signature provides a secondary source of truth that confirms the integrity of the files. The signatures are created using a Ed25519 public/private keypair and <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">Libsodium</a> to sign the files’ contents.</p>\n<p>Mann keeps the private key offline and has published the public key online. The public key will not change and if a core update is signed by a different key, it is a red flag and the update should be avoided. In addition, commits made to the <a href="https://github.com/DisplaceTech/release-hashes">release hashes repository</a> on GitHub are signed with <a href="https://keybase.io/eamann">Mann&#8217;s PGP key</a> to verify that he is the one who added new code.</p>\n<p>Mann admits that the solution is not fool-proof and is working towards improving it. In future versions, the plugin will only notify the user of a WordPress core update if a digital signature is available. Plugins and themes are on the roadmap as well with the ability to opt-in.</p>\n<p>Although he is the only person allowed to digitally sign packages, the model is not sustainable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I prove out the update system, I’ll also begin adding sets of public keys that are scoped to specific sets of packages,&#8221; Mann said. &#8220;This will, for example, allow me to whitelist a small number of trusted developers to also sign core packages. It might also empower plugin developers to sign their own releases (but not anyone else’s).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mann is seeking feedback and is hoping the project provides evidence that something like it can be added to WordPress core.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 03 Mar 2018 00:56:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"Post Status: Marketing and positioning WordPress products — Draft podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=44157";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"https://poststatus.com/marketing-positioning-wordpress-products-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2776:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Without it, users will experience unnecessary frustration and hamper enthusiasm of the new editor. In an effort to figure out what plugins are already compatible with Gutenberg, Daniel Bachhuber <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/03/01/introducing-the-gutenberg-plugin-compatibility-database/">has created</a> a <a href="https://plugincompat.danielbachhuber.com/">Gutenberg Plugin Compatibility Database</a>.</p>\n<img />Gutenberg Plugin Compatibility Database\n<p>The database contains 5,000 plugins that represent more than 90% of the total active install count. Plugins are compatible with Gutenberg if they meet the following two requirements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A WordPress user can perform the same functional task with Gutenberg active. For instance, if the plugin includes an &#8216;Add Media&#8217; button, it&#8217;s considered Gutenberg-compatible when it has a block registered for the Gutenberg inserter.</li>\n<li>There are no (obvious) errors when the WordPress plugin is active alongside Gutenberg.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to participate in the testing process, you&#8217;ll need to <a href="https://plugincompat.danielbachhuber.com/#account-details/">register an account</a> on the site. Once approved, testers will be able to create a fresh sandboxed WordPress install on the site and test randomly selected plugins. After a manual review is complete, plugins will be marked as <code>is_compatible=yes</code> or <code>is_compatible=no</code>.</p>\n<p>Some plugins are already classified with <code>is_compatible=likely_yes</code> or <code>is_compatible=likely_</code>. As reports are completed, two pie charts that display compatibility results at the bottom of the site update automatically.</p>\n<p>Bachhuber estimates that if each plugin takes about a minute to test, they&#8217;ll need roughly 75 person-hours to get through the remaining 4,500 plugins in the database. This project is a great opportunity for individuals and businesses to contribute back to WordPress via the <a href="https://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/">Five for The Future initiative</a>.</p>\n<p>Ideal testers are those who can review dozens of plugins, but even reviewing a few will help the project.

Unfortunately it introduced a bug that prevented many sites from automatically updating to future releases. To remedy this issue, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordpress-4-9-4-maintenance-release/">version 4.9.4 was released</a> the following day requiring many people to manually update their sites.</p>\n\n<p>While this kind of issue is always regrettable, the good thing is that it was fixed quickly, and that not all sites had updated to 4.9.3 yet, which meant they bypassed the bug in that version.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more technical information about this issue <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/06/wordpress-4-9-4-release-the-technical-details/">on the Core development blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The WordCamp Incubator is Back</h2>\n\n<p>In 2016, the Global Community Team ran an experimental program to help spread WordPress to underserved areas by providing more significant organizing support for their first WordCamp event. This program was dubbed the WordCamp Incubator, and it was so successful in the three cities where it ran that <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordcamp-incubator-2-0/">the program is back for 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the Community Team is looking for cities to be a part of this year’s incubator by <a href="https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-city-application">taking applications</a>. Additionally, each incubator community will need an experienced WordCamp organizer to assist them as a co-lead organizer for their event — if that sounds interesting to you, then you can <a href="https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-co-lead-application">fill in the application form for co-leads</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out further information about the WordCamp Incubator <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/19/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-announcement/">on the Community Team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordPress Meetup Roundtables scheduled for March</h2>\n\n<p>In order to assist local WordPress meetup organizers with running their meetup groups, some members of the Community Team have organized <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/23/wordpress-meetup-roundtables-scheduled-for-march/">weekly meetup roundtable discussions through the month of March</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These will be run as video chats at 16:00 UTC every Wednesday this month and will be a great place for meetup organizers to come together and help each other out with practical ideas and advice.</p>\n\n<p>If you are not already in the WordPress meetup program and would like to join, you can find out more information in <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/">the WordPress Meetup Organizer Handbook</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>GDPR Compliance in WordPress Core</h2>\n\n<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an upcoming regulation that will affect all online services across Europe. In order to prepare for this, a working group has been formed to make sure that WordPress is compliant with the GDPR regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the fact that this will be a requirement for the project going forward, it will also have an important and significant impact on the privacy and security of WordPress as a whole. The working group has posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/19/proposed-roadmap-tools-for-gdpr-compliance/">their proposed roadmap</a> for this project and it looks very promising.</p>\n\n<p>To get involved in building WordPress Core, jump into the #gdpr-compliance channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>WPShout published <a href="https://wpshout.com/complete-guide-wordpress-security/">a thorough guide to WordPress security</a>.</li>\n    <li>The Community Team has published interesting statistics from the WordCamp program in <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/27/wordcamps-in-2016/">2016</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/28/wordcamps-in-2017/">2017</a>.</li>\n    <li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/15/potential-addition-of-a-new-onboarding-team/">An intriguing proposal has been made</a> for a new ‘Onboarding’ team to be started in the WordPress project.</li>\n    <li>The new editing experience for WordPress, named Gutenberg, continues to be actively developed with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/16/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16th-february/">a feature-packed release</a> this past month.</li>\n    <li>The Advanced WordPress Facebook group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vS_jR5-nIo">held an interview with WordPress co-founder, Matt Mullenweg</a> about the Gutenberg project.</li>\n    <li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2018/02/27/two-factor-authentication-on-wp-org/">Two factor authentication is on its way to the WordPress.org network</a> — this will be a great improvement to the overall security of the project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/">submit it here</a>.</em></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 01 Mar 2018 08:41:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Hugh Lashbrooke";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 306 – AMP, GDPR, and Brewing Beer At The Boss’ House";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=78185&preview=true&preview_id=78185";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-306-amp-gdpr-and-brewing-beer-at-the-boss-house";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1707:"<p>In this episode, <a href="http://jjj.me">John James Jacoby</a> joins me live from Hutchinson, KS, to talk about the news of the week.

We came up with some changes that feel deeply satisfying. Changes we think should help HeroPress, help readers, and help us as content producers. So here we go.</p>\n<h3>Financial Changes</h3>\n<p>At various times in the past people have told me that the time I spend on HeroPress is worth compensation. When I first started it as a blog, I had no intention of getting money from it. However, being compensated for my time helped ease the burden on my family.</p>\n<blockquote><p>With that in mind, last fall I test-drove a donation page based on interest from some in the community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was a good idea, and I’m thankful for the support I received, but for now it’s not the right path.</p>\n<p>So, I’ve pulled the donation page from the site and am no longer accepting site sponsors. You’ll notice I do have a Sponsorship page, but it lists organizations that have made material contributions like hosting, plugins, etc.</p>\n<h3>Content Changes</h3>\n<p>We’ve been publishing every Wednesday for several years now. Over time, readership has climbed quite a bit. That’s great, but it means that many current readers have never seen the earlier content, which remains quite evergreen.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To address this, we’re going to do new HeroPress essays once a month. The other weeks of the month will be replays of earlier essays.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This allows for some breathing room in gathering new contributors and brings back some really great content that shouldn’t be forgotten.</p>\n<p>It also opens up my time to explore the community more. To see if there are new ways that people, particularly on the fringe, can be helped. Sharing stories is useful, but are there other opportunities and needs we’re missing?</p>\n<h3>The Future</h3>\n<p>So HeroPress will continue. I still love doing it. At various times we’ve discussed making it bigger, doing grand things. But not now. For now we’re going to let it grow organically and continue letting it serve its purpose: to give voice to WordPress stories, to make them known, to inspire.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Changes Coming To HeroPress" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Changes%20Coming%20To%20HeroPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fchanges-coming-heropress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Changes Coming To HeroPress" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fchanges-coming-heropress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fchanges-coming-heropress%2F&title=Changes+Coming+To+HeroPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Changes Coming To HeroPress"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/changes-coming-heropress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/plugins/rtsocial/images/default-pinterest.png&description=Changes Coming To HeroPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Changes Coming To HeroPress"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/changes-coming-heropress/" title="Changes Coming To HeroPress"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/changes-coming-heropress/">Changes Coming To HeroPress</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 12:00:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"WPTavern: New Team Forms to Facilitate GDPR Compliance in WordPress Core";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=78149";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"https://wptavern.com/new-team-forms-to-facilitate-gdpr-compliance-in-wordpress-core";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6200:"<p>As May 25th, the enforcement date for the <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) draws near, individuals and businesses are scrambling to make sure they&#8217;re compliant. I&#8217;ve read a number of blog posts throughout the WordPress community explaining the GDPR and what needs to be done for compliance and it&#8217;s a tough thing to grasp.</p>\n<p>The EU GDPR was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, protect and empower European citizens data privacy, and reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. In reading the regulation and various blog posts, the terminology makes it appear that the changes are geared towards large, international businesses that process personal data.</p>\n<p>However, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/gdpr-for-web-developers/">according to Heather Burns</a>, a digital law specialist in Glasgow, Scotland, the GDPR affects sites large and small.</p>\n<blockquote><p>GDPR applies to all businesses, organizations, sectors, situations, and scenarios, regardless of a business’s size, head count, or financial turnover. A small app studio is every bit as beholden to these rules as a large corporation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Determining if your site needs to be compliant and how to accomplish it can be overwhelming. If you do business in Europe or collect data from European users, you must protect that data in accordance with the GDPR as if you were in Europe. For example, if you operate a blog with a contact form that saves entries to the database from people who live in Europe, you must make your site GDPR compliant.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of aspects to the GDPR and while an excerpt can not fully explain it at a glance, there are a few themes that stick out to me.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be upfront and concise about what data is stored, sent, and used on the site or form.</li>\n<li>Give the user a chance to consent without automatically opting them in.</li>\n<li>Collect the least amount of data possible for legitimate business purposes.</li>\n<li>Provide a way for users to download or access their data and remove it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many of these are common sense practices that are not implemented on many sites, WP Tavern included. How often do you visit a <a href="https://wptavern.com/contact-me">site&#8217;s contact form</a> and see an explanation as to why those fields are required, where the data is stored, where it goes, and what is done with it? This is something I&#8217;ll be working on in the next few weeks.</p>\n<h2>Making WordPress Core GDPR Compliant</h2>\n<p>Earlier <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/13/gdpr-compliance-agenda-february-14/">this month</a>, a number of volunteers gathered to discuss GDPR compliance in WordPress core. The meeting took place in a newly created channel #gdpr-compliance that&#8217;s accessible to anyone with a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">SlackHQ account</a>.</p>\n<p>The team created a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/19/proposed-roadmap-tools-for-gdpr-compliance/">proposed roadmap</a> to add privacy tools to core. The plan includes the following ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add notices for registered users and commenters on what data is collected in core by default and explain why.</li>\n<li>Create guidelines for plugins on how to become GDPR compliant.</li>\n<li>Create and add tools to facilitate compliance and privacy in general.</li>\n<li>Add documentation and help for site owners to learn how to use these tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C9695RJBW/p1519227959000760">Earlier today</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/27/gdpr-compliance-chat-recap-february-21st/">the team met</a> and created a <a href="https://github.com/gdpr-compliance/info">GitHub folder</a> that houses the roadmap, knowledge base, trac ticket list, and other items associated with the project. There was also some discussion on whether the interface provided by the <a href="https://www.gdprwp.com/">GDPR for WordPress project</a> is a good foundation for core and plugins to report personal data. The GDPR Compliance Slack channel is also a good place to ask questions and discuss data privacy in general.</p>\n<p>Popular form plugins such as <a href="https://docs.gravityforms.com/wordpress-gravity-forms-and-gdpr-compliance/">GravityForms</a> and <a href="https://ninjaforms.com/gdpr-compliance-wordpress-forms/">NinjaForms</a> have documentation available that explains GDPR compliance and how it applies to their products. For those who use the Contact Form module in Jetpack which <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/8430">saves entries to the database by default</a>, you&#8217;ll need to wait for further updates. <a href="https://woocommerce.com/2017/12/gdpr-compliance-woocommerce/">WooCommerce</a> and <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/automattic-gdpr/">Automattic</a> have announced that they expect their products will be GDPR compliant by the time it goes into effect later this year.</p>\n<h2>GDPR Resources</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re like me, reading about the GDPR and its policies can make your head spin. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that at the heart of the GDPR are common sense behaviors for handling personal data.

The interview concludes the <a href="http://www.advancedwp.org/awp-gutenberg-interview-series/">Advanced WordPress Gutenberg interview series</a> that includes, <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2018/02/06/awp-gutenberg-interview-series-with-joost-de-valk/">Joost de Valk</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2018/02/18/awp-gutenberg-interview-series-with-ahmad-awais/">Ahmad Awais</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/ic_du_lsbLE">Tammie Lister</a>.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg began the session by explaining why there is a concerted effort to improve the editor. &#8220;It&#8217;s really almost any user test that you watch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Both watching people brand new to WordPress and those with years of experience on how they used the editor. It became obvious that we could make something more accessible to new users, but also, a lot more powerful for developers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With regards to a release date, Mullenweg confirmed that Gutenberg will ship when it&#8217;s ready. Later in the interview, Mullenweg was asked if he could provide a more concrete answer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For those who want a concrete date, we will have one or two orders of magnitude more users of Gutenberg in April,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean necessarily a 5.0 release, but it does mean that if you&#8217;re planning on aiming for something where a lot of users will be interacting with Gutenberg, aim for April.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While the project&#8217;s name is Gutenberg, some developers have <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4681">expressed concerns</a> on how the name will be deprecated if at all once it&#8217;s merged into core. There are a number of educational resources, products, and tool kits referencing Gutenberg that could be a source of confusion once it&#8217;s merged into core and referred to as the editor.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg was asked if the Gutenberg name will be deprecated. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the most important thing to figure out right now. We&#8217;re tackling some much bigger issues. If the plugin is useful, we&#8217;ll keep it around for beta testing, if not, we&#8217;ll have it turn itself off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg concluded the interview thanking the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/">Advanced WordPress Facebook</a> group for the passion and discussions shared by members. The group has more than 30K members, is free to join, well maintained, and often filled with interesting topics.

This has worked very well in many communities, with over 120 WordCamps being hosted around the world in 2017.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes though, passionate and enthusiastic community members can’t pull together enough people in their community to make a WordCamp happen.

All three of these WordCamp incubators <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/30/wordcamp-incubator-report/">were a great success</a>, so we&#x27;re bringing the incubator program back for 2018.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Where should the next WordCamp incubators be? If you have always wanted a WordCamp in your city but haven’t been able to get a community started, this is a great opportunity. We will be taking applications for the next few weeks, then will get in touch with everyone who applied to discuss the possibilities. We will announce the chosen cities by the end of March.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>To apply, </strong><a href="https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-city-application"><strong>fill in the application</strong></a><strong> by March 15, 2018.</strong> You don’t need to have any specific information handy, it’s just a form to let us know you’re interested. You can apply to nominate your city even if you don’t want to be the main organizer, but for this to work well we will need local liaisons and volunteers, so please only nominate cities where you live or work so that we have at least one local connection to begin.<br /></p>\n\n<p>We&#x27;re looking forward to hearing from you!<br /></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 22:53:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Hugh Lashbrooke";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"HeroPress: How To Build A Company With WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2465";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:120:"https://heropress.com/essays/build-company-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=build-company-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16946:"<img width="960" height="480" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/022118-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: If you keep showing up, you''d be surprised what happens." />.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n<div class="embed-container"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Full text of the above video</h4>\n<p>Hey, y&#8217;all! Thanks for inviting me to come share my story on HeroPress. I&#8217;m so excited to be able to talk a little bit to the HeroPress community.</p>\n<p>So, and I&#8217;m doing a video blog or vlog because this is what I do; I&#8217;m a YouTube person. I create YouTube videos every single Wednesday for what I call WordPress Wednesday to help you improve your online marketing inside of the WordPress world. So I&#8217;m used to doing videos, and I asked if I could do my HeroPress story in this format; and they said go for it, so I&#8217;m excited to talk to you at least in a face-to-face scenario.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to  share a little bit of my story and tell you how WordPress basically became my avenue for becoming a millionaire in just five short years.</p>\n<h3>The Beginning</h3>\n<p>So in 1998, I created my very first ever HTML website. My dad was actually doing websites at the time, and I needed a website for my band because that&#8217;s what I wanted to be is a rockstar; so I learned how to build a website, kind of, under his training and a little bit of self-taught stuff and had a lot of fun doing it that way in 1998.</p>\n<p>And then in 2005, I started hearing about WordPress; but in 2008, as I was freelancing around, a client asked me to build him a website. And they said, &#8220;hey, Kori, can you, can you build me a website, but we absolutely have to have it on WordPress?&#8221; I was like, sure, no problem; straight to Google, &#8220;how do you build a WordPress website&#8221;, you know. And over the weekend I pretty much taught myself how to build out a WordPress website, and I loved it.</p>\n<p>My mind was absolutely blown when I saw the drag and drop options inside of menus to create dropdowns, and a form builder; I was just blown away. So those of you who have struggled in the HTML CSS world, you know the magic or the majesty, if you will even, of WordPress and those environments and how easy it makes it. So when I saw that, I really just thought, oh my goodness, this is a full-circle moment for me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I really want to use WordPress now from here on forward.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So I reached back out to my dad and said, &#8220;hey, dad, you know, this is a tool that our customers, all of our clients, have been asking us for&#8221;. They&#8217;ve been wanting access to their websites, and we&#8217;ve not been able to give it to them because, in the past, they had to download Dreamweaver, you know, Photoshop and an FTP program; and that was just too much nerd code for them. So we wanted to be able to give them something like this, and WordPress definitely was that solution.</p>\n<p>So he and I worked back and forth for a few years learning, really truly learning, WordPress; and then in 2012, we decided to launch together, my mom, my dad and I, decided to launch WebTegrity in San Antonio, Texas. And it was a very small concept initially; you know, we just me, literally, the three of us, and me and my folks. And then we hired on a subcontractor who is a great graphic designer here in town to try to help us with the creative side of things, and we started to grow our team.</p>\n<h3>Going Big Time</h3>\n<p>So how did we, in five years, build it up in such a way that we were able to sell it for a deal of a million dollars&#8217; worth of shares, which ultimately is a $20 million value deal? How did we do that? I&#8217;m going to give you a little bit of insight on how we were able to accomplish that in such a short time.</p>\n<p>So the very first thing I want you to realize is we did this in a saturated industry in San Antonio, Texas. When I did a search for web developer or web design firms back in 2012, I had over 700 results of different either freelancers or agencies or ad agencies or some solution out there that was either in the general area, or in the nearby area, that provided that service. So how did we, in six years, end up becoming number six in the entire city? We ranked in the top 10; how did we do that?</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the very first things we did, was we niched ourselves; and, thankfully, WordPress was that solution.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2012, there was not an agency directly in San Antonio that was trying to be the go-to place for WordPress; and we purposely started stepping up and saying we are WordPress only, WordPress only, WordPress only. So if you were looking for a different type of CMS solution, we were not the right fit for you. And very, very quickly, we also started teaching it in the city; so we would teach other agencies. We provided on-site training; we provided weekend workshops. All for a price tag, of course; but that was one of our revenue streams. And, again, it set us as the authority in the city for WordPress; so really important that you understand how to niche yourselves and not try to be all things to all people.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The second thing we tried to do was really build a culture.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And you can see, I don&#8217;t work around boring walls. Everything that I do has to have creative juices flowing around me, right. We just want to create a great culture, a great environment. So we had to hire the right people. So that&#8217;s my next tip to you is be very, very careful on who you allow into your culture of your business, who you hire on, and certainly who you bring on as a leader in your culture in your community. So one of the things that we did right away was realize that we can&#8217;t teach passion, so you gotta find people that have a passion to nerd out on stuff like this.</p>\n<p>And you have to find people who have great integrity to just do their best at all times, and you have to find people who love to be creative and love to solve problems for clients, right, who aren&#8217;t just salespeople, right? So if you can find those things, you can teach nerd code all day long; so be sure to just find people with the right hearts to join your community and then train them up the right way, be sure that you just grow and grow and grow your culture in a healthy way, right.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And another thing that we did, so this is another tip, was understand how to really build a revenue stream that was going to be sustainable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>All right, so wrap your heads around this one because this one&#8217;s key. Very early on in our model as we were selling WordPress websites, part of my pitch was, oh, it&#8217;s just five grand and no more after that. It&#8217;s a one-time fee and you&#8217;re done. That&#8217;s a horrible business strategy. We learned very early on, inside of WordPress world, that you have rain or shine, right; so there&#8217;s a lot of clients coming or there are no clients.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re either slammed working from home even in the evening trying to catch up, or you&#8217;re out on the golf course wondering if you&#8217;re going to get a paycheck next week. It&#8217;s really rain or shine. So how do you create a sustainable model in your business, in your small agency, in your startup; how do you do that, so that when those slow seasons come, you can still pay your team members, you can still keep your lights on?</p>\n<p>Well, we were sitting at a WordCamp; and Jason Cohen from WP Engine was keynoting; and one of the things he said right away is, if you don&#8217;t understand how to create a reoccurring revenue stream in your small agency, you will turn your sign to closed in the next year or two. And he was so right; and it was such a light bulb moment for me that I went back straightaway from that weekend WordCamp up in Austin and I started writing out, okay, how can we create a reoccurring revenue stream? What would that look like inside of our industry?</p>\n<p>And, of course, it was support packages. We didn&#8217;t call them maintenance plans. We certainly didn&#8217;t use retainer, which can have a sense of a negative connotation, right, because of lawyers; sorry! But, still, we didn&#8217;t want to use those words because we&#8217;re already almost creating a, uh, I don&#8217;t think I want to sign up for that type of attitude.</p>\n<p>What we did is we called it support, and very easily, clients were signing up saying, oh, goodness, yes, I need that ongoing support. So use that phrasing, create a model structure where it&#8217;s required, at least for the first 12 months out of the gate as they launch that you are charging them something even as small as $99 a month. And don&#8217;t shortchange yourself on that; put together a great package that you give them that type of value.</p>\n<p>If you were to check out WebTegrity.com, you would see our support plans and what they consist of and the pricing. We&#8217;re very transparent with that. That&#8217;s the way our revenue stream almost doubled our sales in one year and allowed us to keep our lights on when June and July roll around and nobody cares about their websites because they&#8217;re on the beach.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All right, reputation was another huge part of it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s one of the reasons why we named ourselves WebTegrity, but reputation, understanding that that every client that signs up, whether they&#8217;re a $5,000 website or a $50,000 website gets the same type of boutique-style, white glove, handholding relationship, right? Every single project that you launch, you want to produce the absolute, absolute best. You&#8217;re not shortchanging them; you&#8217;re not, you&#8217;re not wiring something that you hand off to the client and hope to God it doesn&#8217;t break. You really are trying to find the absolute best solution.</p>\n<p>One of the things that also kept us in high standing with our reputation, of course, was offering that training because what we don&#8217;t want to do is keep the veil covered where nobody can see what we&#8217;re doing, right. We really want to be transparent and train our clients the nerd lingo, train the clients what SEO is and what expectations should be. Having that type of open communication really just started to build together a relationship with our clients that they trusted us; and we met their expectation, right. So be sure to hold strongly to your core values for your reputation. Be sure that you&#8217;re asking people to give you great reviews because that&#8217;ll make a difference.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And the last thing I want to talk about is give back.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So at one of the WordCamp US&#8217;s that I went to, Matt himself said, listen, if you&#8217;re making a living with WordPress, you really need to try to figure out how to give back 5% of your time, just 5% of your time a week. How can you do that to give back to the community? Can you start a meet-up group, teach a meetup group; can you facilitate a meetup group where maybe you&#8217;re just the organizer and you never have to speak because you&#8217;re not a fan of speaking?</p>\n<p>Can you organize a WordCamp, volunteer at a WordCamp? Can you write a tutorial and tell people how to do things? Can you teach a workshop; can you make a video?</p>\n<p>And, again, I had a light bulb moment. Of course, I can make videos. So my giveback to the WordPress community is my YouTube channel; every single Wednesday, I&#8217;m creating a video and putting it out there for free to the WordPress world of how to improve your online marketing. That&#8217;s made a huge impact not only, thankfully, inside the WordPress community, but also in my own business model.</p>\n<p>I actually go into WordCamps around the US and people are like, hey, aren&#8217;t you that WordPress girl; don&#8217;t you do videos? It&#8217;s a really cool feeling to be able to give back to the community because I&#8217;ve made my living using WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Understanding</h3>\n<p>So ultimately how did I turn five years into a multi-million dollar buyout? Because we have just recently sold; how did we do that? Ultimately, it was understanding that you have to be able to grow something of value. So as soon as you start your business, you should also be thinking about your exit strategy, right, even in how you name your company.</p>\n<p>If I were to name this Ashton Agency, do you think that I could&#8217;ve just walked away and handed the keys to somebody else named Johnson; it wouldn&#8217;t have worked. Think even about your name; will it stand alone? Can that become a brand that you can hand off and sell as a holistic entity?</p>\n<p>You also want to think about that revenue stream, right, and watch those sales margins. Be sure that your margins are healthy. Don&#8217;t hire until it hurts, until it absolutely hurts. Be sure that you&#8217;re structuring your offerings in such a way that you&#8217;re actually recouping your value. What does that mean? Just understand business better; watch Shark Tank, read more tutorials like this, watch more videos.</p>\n<p>Get a hold of the WordPress community, the core leaders, the speakers that travel around to all the WordCamps. Start following them on Twitter and trying to understand what it is that they&#8217;re training and teaching. There&#8217;s a lot of resources out there for you to gain some ideas from, but ultimately it was me stepping out in the San Antonio community because it was a larger firm here in San Antonio who purchased us.</p>\n<p>So we just kept hammering on the fact that we were the go-to place here in San Antonio for WordPress. We kept training; we kept doing free opportunities, going out and speaking at different events; and people kept seeing us. We kept showing up, so you&#8217;d be surprised what happens. If you keep giving back and you keep showing up to places, you keep establishing yourself as the authority, you keep learning and training and growing your own skill set and growing your team, before you know it, it can happen for you.</p>\n<p>I hope this has been helpful. If you have questions about some of this though, if you&#8217;re trying to grow up your startup, or if you&#8217;re trying to learn how to improve your revenue margins, I&#8217;m always open to a quick twitter conversation or send me an email. I&#8217;d love to connect with you.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for the opportunity to share this on HeroPress.</p>\n<p>Bye, y&#8217;all; catch me over on YouTube.

You don&#8217;t need to support every version of WordPress, and you don&#8217;t have to support every version of PHP. Feel free to do this for seemingly selfish reasons. Supporting old versions is hard. You have to &#8220;unlearn&#8221; new WordPress and PHP features and use their older equivalents, or even have code branches that do version/feature checks. It increases your development and testing time. It increases your support burden.</p>\n<p>Economics might force your hand here&#8230; a bit. You can&#8217;t very well, even in 2018, require that everyone be running PHP 7.1 and the latest version of WordPress. But consider the following:</p>\n<p>97% of WordPress installs are running PHP 5.3 or higher. This gives you namespaces, late static binding, closures, Nowdoc, <strong>__DIR</strong><strong>__</strong>, and more.</p>\n<p>88% of WordPress installs are running PHP 5.4 or higher. This gives you short array syntax, traits, function-array dereferencing, guaranteed <strong>&lt;?=</strong> echo syntax availability, <strong>$this</strong> access in closures, and more.</p>\n<p>You get even more things with PHP 5.5 and 5.6 (64% of installs are running 5.6 or higher), but a lot of the syntactic goodness came in 5.3 and 5.4, with very few people running versions less than 5.4. So stop typing <strong>array()</strong>, stop writing named function handlers for simple <strong>array_map()</strong> uses, and start using namespaces to organize and simplify your code.</p>\n<p>Okay, so&#8230; how?</p>\n<p>I recommend that your main plugin file just be a simple bootstrapper, where you define your autoloader, do a few checks, and then call a method that initializes your plugin code. I also recommend that this main plugin file be PHP 5.2 compatible. This should be easy to do (just be careful not to use <strong>__DIR__</strong>).</p>\n<p>In this file, you should check the minimum PHP and WordPress versions that you are going to support. And if the minimums are not reached, have the plugin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Not initialize (you don&#8217;t want syntax errors).</li>\n<li>Display an admin notice saying which minimum version was not met.</li>\n<li>Deactivate itself (optional).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do not <strong>die()</strong> or <strong>wp_die()</strong>. That&#8217;s &#8220;rude&#8221;, and a bad user experience. Your goal here is for them to update WordPress or ask their host to move them off an ancient version of PHP, so be kind.</p>\n<p>Here is what I use:</p>\n<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/markjaquith/a08623974b37c2cf0207ee2b120b54da">View code on GitHub</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/markjaquith/status/965605448408813569">Reach out on Twitter</a> and let me know what methods you use to manage PHP and WordPress versions in your plugin!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Do you need <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">WordPress services?</a></b></p>\n<p>Mark runs <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">Covered Web Services</a> which specializes in custom WordPress solutions with focuses on security, speed optimization, plugin development and customization, and complex migrations.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to start a conversation!</p>\n[contact-form]";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 15:14:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"Post Status: How WebDevStudios is serving different market segments — Draft podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=43724";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"https://poststatus.com/webdevstudios-serving-different-market-segments-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2637:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

You can put in your email to read I believe but it&#x27;s behind a paywall otherwise. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/">The Information</a> is a pretty excellent site that alongside (former Automattician) <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Ben Thompson&#x27;s Stratechery</a> I recommend subscribing to. Here are some quotes from the parts of the article that quote me or talk about <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">\n    <p>So it’s no coincidence that one of the first companies to operate with a distributed workforce has roots in the open source movement. Automattic, the company behind open source software tools like WordPress, was founded in 2005 and has always allowed its employees to work from anywhere. The company’s 680 employees are based in 63 countries and speak 79 languages. Last year, it closed its San Francisco office, a converted warehouse — because so few employees were using it. It still has a few coworking spaces scattered around the globe.</p>\n    <p>Matt Mullenweg, Automattic’s founder and CEO, said that when the company first started, its employees communicated via IRC, an early form of instant messaging. Now it uses a whole host of software that’s tailor-made for remote work, and as the technology evolves, Automattic adopts what they need.</p>\n    <p>Mr. Mullenweg said Automattic only started having regular meetings, for instance, after it started using Zoom, a video conferencing tool that works even on slow internet connections.</p>\n    <p>He’s become a proponent of office-less companies and shares what he’s learned with other founders who are attempting it. Mr. Mullenweg said he believes the distributed approach has led to employees who are even more loyal to the company and that his employees especially appreciate that they don’t need to spend a chunk of their day on a commute.</p>\n    <p>“Our retention is off the charts,” he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">\n    <p>“Where it goes wrong is if they don’t have a strong network outside of work—they can become isolated and fall into bad habits,” Mr. Mullenweg said. He said he encourages employees to join groups, play sports and have friends outside of work. That kind of thing wouldn’t be a risk at big tech companies, where employees are encouraged to socialize and spend a lot of time with colleagues.</p>\n    <p>But for those who ask him about the negatives, Mr. Mullenweg offers anecdotal proof of a workaround.</p>\n    <p>For example, he said he has 14 employees in Seattle who wanted to beat the isolation by meeting up for work once a week. So they found a local bar that didn’t open until 5 p.m., pooled together the $250 per month co-working stipends that Automattic provides and convinced the bar’s owner to let them rent out the place every Friday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They didn&#x27;t need to pool all their co-working allowance to get the bar, I recall it was pretty cheap! Finally:</p>\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">\n    <p>For Automattic, flying 700 employees to places like Whistler, British Columbia or Orlando, Florida, has turned into a seven-figure expense.</p>\n    <p>“I used to joke that we save it on office space and blow it on travel. But the reality is that in-person is really important.

You see it in React.js and Vue.js emerging as popular front end standards, in the rise of Elasticsearch and NoSQL platforms, with two factor authentication and Google single sign on, with the rise of modern Asset Management Systems.</li>\n<li>For publishers, it’s increasingly becoming about distribution to multiple platforms, more so than<em> just</em> building a website. Google AMP, Facebook Articles, Apple News, Alexa, YouTube channels to name a few.</li>\n<li>If you need any more evidence of WordPress dominance, look no further than how highly in demand top-tier engineering talent is. It’s probably &#8211; literally &#8211; around a factor of 1.5x &#8211; 2x what great engineers were earning 3-4 years ago.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With seven years of experience under his belt, Goldman offers the following advice for those who are in their first or second year of running an agency or in a leadership position.</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Don’t be quite so hard on yourself &#8211; when you run a business &#8211; when you’re a lease &#8211; there will always be highs and lows &#8211; don’t dwell on the lows.</li>\n<li>Put more emphasis on building systems, routines, and check-ins that offer a better pulse on the collective and individual fulfillment, engagement, and health of the team, rather than relying on transparent upwards communication.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Congrats to 10up on seven years in business.

I know the birthday of more or less five people. I insist on saying that my son was born on May 11. Incorrect, I was born on May 11, he on May 17. But for some reason, my WordPress dates are permanently etched into my brain. I think it’s because meeting the global WordPress community and helping restart the Italian community are very meaningful moments in my adult life. Please join me in a walk down memory lane <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<h3>May 15, 2015</h3>\n<p>I started building websites with WordPress in 2010: my first website was my own blog, whose only purpose was to publish photos of my son so all the grandparents could enjoy seeing him grow. I enjoyed tinkering around with it, and to my surprise someone wrote asking me to build something similar for them. And they wanted to pay me for it!</p>\n<p>For a few years I worked as an administrative manager during the day and as a web designer at night until I decided to make the jump and become a freelancer.</p>\n<p>I never thought about contributing to WordPress because I wasn’t a back end developer and I didn’t think the project needed people that were not code wizards. Heck, I didn’t even know how WordPress was made or how open source worked exactly!</p>\n<blockquote><p>And then I went to a Freelancers conference in Italy and on May 15 I gave my first talk ever.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Up until that moment I taught small classes, but I never talked in front of more than ten people. I was terrified: in the audience there were more than a hundred people. Some of my friends, but also a lot of seasoned professionals that I respected and admired, and here I was talking about how they should and shouldn’t build a website. I was so nervous, when I grabbed the mic I did such a wide gesture with my arms that the bracelet I was wearing flew through the air to the other side of the room.</p>\n<p>After my talk a guy came to compliment my talk, and I realised that he was one of those people that I respected and admired from afar: <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasartoni">Luca Sartoni</a>, an Automattician whose blog I have been following for a while.</p>\n<p>For the three days of the event we kept chatting about websites, WordPress, entrepreneurship, open source until he convinced me to start a WordPress meetup in my hometown of Torino, Italy. He put me in contact with other people that he knew wanted to do something similar and in less than a month from that conversation we started a meetup. The group now has more than one thousand members, and in March we will celebrate thirty events.</p>\n<h3>November 7, 2015</h3>\n<p>Luca didn’t stop his proselytism in Torino <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /> That same year, WordCamp Europe was held in Seville and at the Polyglots table a revolution was started. A small group of Italians, used to travelling abroad to attend WordCamps, met there and decided that it was time to organise the Italian community.</p>\n<p>The first step was to revive the blog on the Italian WordPress website: it was dormant for seven years and the first thing we did was publish the dates of meetups that were slowly but surely appearing in the whole country. At the beginning of 2015 there were two meetups in Italy, by August there were eight and their number kept growing.</p>\n<p>Now, if you have met Italians, you know we talk a lot. The two Francescos from Apulia, <a href="https://twitter.com/franzvitulli">Franz Vitulli</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/fra83">Francesco Di Candia</a>, took the second initiative that was crucial to bringing us together: they opened a Slack workspace for the Italians, modeled after the UK workspace. For the whole summer we chatted every single day: about WordPress, about how to grow and manage the community that was forming in front of our eyes, how to communicate, how to contribute.</p>\n<p>And then chatting wasn’t enough, we wanted to meet in person. We wanted to put a face and a voice to the avatars. With the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/rosso">Sara Rosso</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/miss_jwo">Jenny Wong</a> we carried out a bizarre plan, almost unheard of: a <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2017/12/10/francesca-marano-standalone-contributor-days-help-make-wordpress-with-your-community/">stand alone WordPress Contributor Day</a>. We would meet in Milano for a day to get to know each other and to learn how to Contribute to WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I like to think that November 7 2015 is the day we became a community: we were not an abstract idea anymore, we were people, meeting in person to make WordPress in Italy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>April 10, 2016</h3>\n<p>The next few months went by in a blur of activities: the meetup organisers in Torino applied to host the first WordCamp in Italy in three years and I lead the organising team, I applied to attend the Community Summit in Philadelphia and I got accepted, I attended the first WordCamp US, my first WordCamp, and volunteered at it. I met a lot of people that helped me become more active and more focused: as a new contributor it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the abundance of amazing projects and tasks you can be part of, but it’s important to keep your focus to be more effective.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After meeting people from all over the world and sharing our experiences I realised the story of the Italian community could be inspiring for other communities and it was worth telling it to a wider audience, so I got completely out of my comfort zone and submitted a talk to WordCamp London.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On April 10th 2016 I gave <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2016/05/30/francesca-marano-rebirth-italian-community/">my first talk at a WordCamp</a> and my first talk in English. I think I didn’t sleep for days before and after the event. It was nerve wracking, but I did it without throwing any bracelet in the air this time.</p>\n<a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WCEU2016.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2457 size-large" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WCEU2016-1024x684.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="641" /></a>I gave the same talk at WordCamp Europe in 2016 and realised the story was relatable to many communities. Photographer unknown, sorry <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" />\n<h3>September 17, 2017</h3>\n<p>Over the following year I kept contributing to WordPress, mostly in the Community team. I participated in the Polyglots activities for a while but then I had to pick and focus my attention. The more I interacted with people from all over the world as a hobby, the more I wanted that to become my job. Although my business as a web designer in Italy was doing good, I felt I wanted to be able to reach more people and find a way to be more involved with the community.<br />\nSo I started looking for a job. I was hesitant at first: all the insecurities I had about myself came back to haunt me. The voice in my head was telling me: you are too old, you don’t have enough technical expertise, you have been contributing for a very short time, English is not your native language, you are a single mom from Italy for crying out loud, who would want to employ you?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Well, it turns out that if you actually look for a job instead of just telling yourself that you really would like a job, chances are you might get one.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last September I started a new chapter in my career as the <a href="https://www.siteground.com/blog/francesca-marano/">WordPress Community Manager</a> at SiteGround and I couldn’t be happier.</p>\n<p>The past 33 months have completely changed my life, personally and professionally: along the way I learned a number of lessons that I know will stay with me forever.</p>\n<h3>Step Up</h3>\n<p>If you want to achieve something, start today. Just start. Start a meetup, leave a comment to encourage someone else, volunteer to take notes of a meeting, participate in the discussion, bring your own ideas to the table. Be a fire starter, for yourself and for the people around you.</p>\n<h3>Step Back</h3>\n<p>None of the above is about you: the community is bigger than you, you are here to build a path for the future. Once you started something, don’t become too attached, let it go and let other people step up and shine. Mentor them, if they ask and if you can.</p>\n<h3>If you want to go faster go alone, if you want to go further go together</h3>\n<p>I am not a huge fan of motivational quotes, but this one is very dear to my heart and it’s one I have to remind myself quite often. I am a perfectionist and a quick learner: this is ok when you start your own business (and it’s ok only at the beginning, but this is a topic for another article!), but when you are part of a team, you are part of something bigger. It might move slower, but its impact is immensely more powerful than anything you’ll be able to achieve on your own.</p>\n<h3>Representation matters</h3>\n<p>I dislike speaking in public. When I say this people tend to laugh it off because I am good on stage. It doesn’t mean that I like it.

I used to do that.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t do that anymore.</p>\n<p>Why? <strong>Granularity</strong>.</p>\n<p>One of the benefits of using version control like Git is that when things go wrong, you can pinpoint when they went wrong, and identify what code caused the issue.</p>\n<p>Git has a great tool called <strong>bisect</strong> that takes a known good state in the past and a current broken state, and then jumps around between revisions, efficiently, asking you to report whether that revision is <strong>good</strong> or <strong>bad</strong>. Then it tells you what revision broke your site.</p>\n<p>If you lump all your plugin updates into one commit, you won&#8217;t get that granularity. You&#8217;ll likely get the <strong>git bisect</strong> result of &#8220;great&#8230; one of EIGHTEEN PLUGINS I updated was the issue&#8221;. That doesn&#8217;t help.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how you do it with granularity:</p>\n<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">for plugin in $(wp plugin list --update=available --field=name);\ndo\n    echo "wp plugin update $plugin" &amp;&amp;\n    echo "git add -A wp-content/plugins/$plugin" &amp;&amp;\n    echo "git commit -m ''update $plugin plugin''";\ndone;</pre>\n<p>This code loops through plugins with updates available, updates each one, and commits it with a message that references the plugin being updated. Great! Now <strong>git bisect</strong> will be able to tell you <strong>which</strong> plugin update broke your site.</p>\n<p>And what if you can only run WP-CLI commands from within a VM, and Git commands from your local machine? For instance, if you&#8217;re using my favorite tool, <a href="https://local.getflywheel.com/">Local by Flywheel</a>, you have to SSH into the site&#8217;s container to issue WP-CLI commands, but from within that container, you might not have Git configured like it is on your host machine.</p>\n<p>So what you can do is break the process into two steps.</p>\n<p>On the VM, run this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">wp plugin list --update=available --field=name &gt; plugins.txt\nwp plugin update-all</pre>\n<p>That grabs a list of plugins with updates and writes them to a file <strong>plugins.txt</strong>, and then updates all the plugins.</p>\n<p>And then on your local machine, run this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">while read plugin;\ndo\n    echo "git add -A wp-content/plugins/$plugin" &amp;&amp;\n    echo "git commit -m ''update $plugin plugin''";\ndone; &lt; plugins.txt</pre>\n<p>That slurps in that list of updated plugins and does a distinct <strong>git add</strong> and <strong>git commit</strong> for each.</p>\n<p>When that&#8217;s done, remove <b>plugins.txt</b>.</p>\n<p>All your plugins are quickly updated with WP-CLI, but you get nice granular Git commits and messages.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Do you need <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">WordPress services?</a></b></p>\n<p>Mark runs <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">Covered Web Services</a> which specializes in custom WordPress solutions with focuses on security, speed optimization, plugin development and customization, and complex migrations.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to start a conversation!</p>\n[contact-form]";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:42:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"Post Status: WordPress market opportunities: Upmarket edition — Draft podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=42360";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-market-opportunities-upmarket-edition-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2284:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

They take a look at discovery projects, pitching WordPress against competing platforms, and considerations to make before pitching on these high-budget projects. There are plenty of positives and negatives when working on long-term projects that may have a dramatic impact on your company in many ways.</p>\n<p>In addition to these market opportunities, the boys also discuss recent news including iThemes acquisition by Liquid Web, a welcome change to the WordPress.org plugin directory, and an unfortunate and far-reaching bug that shipped with the 4.9.3 release last week.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://poststatus.com/liquid-web-acquired-ithemes/">Liquid Web acquires iThemes</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://generatewp.com/new-policy-changes-wordpress-plugin-directory/">Plugin directory notice changes</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/06/wordpress-4-9-4-release-the-technical-details/">4.9.4 technical details</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wpsessions.com/sessions/infusing-websites-brand-voice/">Infusing Websites with Brand Voice</a><a href="https://wpsessions.com/teams">WPS Team Training</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sponsor: WooCommerce</h3>\n<p><a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> makes the most customizable eCommerce software on the planet, and it’s the most popular too.

In <a href="https://wptavern.com/jetpack-5-4-introduces-beta-version-of-new-search-module-powered-by-elasticsearch-for-professional-plan-users">October of last year</a>, Jetpack 5.4 began beta testing a new <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/search/">search module</a> based on <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a>. Jetpack 5.8 concludes the beta and the new search service is available to Professional plan customers.</p>\n<p>The new search module replaces the native search functionality in WordPress and Jetpack developers claim sites with a large amount of content, images, or products will see significant speed improvements and more relevant results. Developers can fine-tune the user experience by using custom queries and template tags. Users can sort results by categories, tags, month/year, post type, or any taxonomy.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Content Delivery Network, users have another method to optimize their sites with a new module named Lazy Load Images.

One of my first school memories is of drawing a clown and my art teacher being so enamored with it, she hung it up on her door for the whole year.</p>\n<p>The first time in my educational life I didn’t take an art class was my first year of college. By the end of the year, my fingers were itching and I was ready to scream — I had to take art. It didn’t take long for me to declare a Studio Art minor, which eventually became an Arts and Technology minor my senior year.</p>\n<p>I’ve also always been an internet kid. We received our first internet-connected Windows desktop in 1997. I’ll never forget the sound of dial-up as I signed into AOL, day after day for years to come. When my older brother started working for an ISP, we were able to go beyond just using AOL to connect, and I started spending more time exploring websites (rather than just AOL’s apps and chat rooms). I wanted to be like my older brother and learn how to make sites. I taught myself basic HTML by using View Source on existing sites — even back then, I was benefiting from the open web!</p>\n<p>Angelfire was my earliest web canvas. A couple of my friends eventually got into making websites, but I was always a little disdainful of them for using Homestead’s GUI builder, while I was making my sites from scratch. I had a blast making image-rich personal and fan sites with tables and HTML styles. Landing a copy of Photoshop Elements in high school only intensified my enjoyment of web design. I kept that passion up through college, when I found my first design gig.</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/old_web_site.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2442 aligncenter" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/old_web_site-1024x479.jpg" alt="Old Website, best viewed on AOL" width="960" height="449" /></a></p>\n<h3>Could this be a career?</h3>\n<p>My first year of college got off to a bit of a rough financial start. By the time my financial aid was finalized and I was finally able to pick a work study job, my options were pretty limited. A dance professor needed an assistant to help her with some photocopying and organization tasks, along with helping her build out a print and web portfolio.</p>\n<p>I was honestly a terrible assistant, but I did a pretty good job with the design work. I continued to refine my skills working in the computers labs in subsequent years, and in my Junior year of college (ten years ago!) I landed an internship at a local web design agency. That internship turned into a part-time job, which opened up doors to more local web design opportunities, and soon I was graduating college and pretty well situated into the start of my career.</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/early-site.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2443" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/early-site-1024x666.jpg" alt="Skeumorphic website design that looks like a notepad with pen ink all over it." width="960" height="624" /></a></p>\n<p>It was at these agencies that I started learning how to build WordPress websites. I’d used WordPress a couple times in college and felt comfortable with it, but now I was focusing a lot more on building my skills as a designer and front-end developer. My girlfriend (who was working at the same web agency) and I managed to convince our boss to start letting us create totally custom websites, rather than customizing existing themes, and that opened up a whole new world of design opportunities.</p>\n<h3>My first WordCamp</h3>\n<p>It was around then that my girlfriend, who attended WordCamp NYC the previous year, noticed the conference organizers were <a href="https://2010.nyc.wordcamp.org/volunteer-designer-needed/">looking for some volunteer designers</a> to help create some graphics. She passed along the information, and I got in touch.</p>\n<p>I collaborated with a few other designers to create the WordCamp branding, which was used across the website, t-shirt, signage, and stickers:</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wcnyc.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2444" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wcnyc.png" alt="WCNYC Banner" width="429" height="286" /></a></p>\n<p>It was amazing to see it everywhere at the WordCamp. It felt really special. Though I didn’t get “props” for this, I still consider it my first contribution to WordPress.</p>\n<p>WordCamp NYC was a ton of fun. I met interesting people, learned a lot about WordPress, and started to get a feel for the community. I left with a desire to get more involved. I browsed through WordPress.org, stumbling upon the “Make” section. I was stoked to see that there was a design group. I couldn’t write much code beyond CSS, but I could contribute my design skills. I joined a couple of the core channels on IRC, including the design channel (#wordpress-ui), and observed for while. I watched how the other designers in the project communicated, what they worked on, where they presented their work, etc. By observing before participating, I could learn the social queues and mores of the community. I didn’t want to embarass myself — I wanted to do things the established way based on community standards.</p>\n<p>What I found to be one of the most difficult parts of contributing was adapting to the technology used to build WordPress. I had to learn how to use command line and SVN. Getting set up in SVN and terminal was probably the biggest thing that stopped me from contributing code during my early years.</p>\n<p>But most of all, it came down to conquering fear. Fear that my design skills would be unwanted and unwelcome; fear that other contributors would look down on me or ignore me, or that they’d find me irritating; fear that I just wasn’t good enough to contribute. Some of this fear persists today, albeit greatly reduced.</p>\n<p>There’s a point at which I managed to conquer a little bit of that fear, stop observing, and really start to pitch in. Slowly, I started chiming in and volunteering for design tasks in IRC and the Make Design p2. I ended up doing a lot of small projects on the community side (rather than the core side) at first — some new landing pages and redesigns of sections on WordPress.org, graphics, and design for my own local meetups. I started feeling more and more confident with my contributions.</p>\n<h3>Core Props</h3>\n<p>By this point, I had done some wireframes and mockups for the core WordPress software — I’d even spoken at a WordCamp! — but I hadn’t actually gotten any code committed. Which meant, at this point in time, I didn’t have any “core props.” I was still really intimidated by Trac and SVN. I was a designer, and most design conversations happened in explicitly design space. But I really wanted to get some code committed into core, so I needed to find a CSS bug I felt qualified to fix.</p>\n<p>At WordCamp Philly in 2012, I finally got a chance. Sunday was devoted to contributing to WordPress. There were experienced core contributors present who could teach people how to make a patch, how to submit a ticket, and suggest tickets for people to work on.</p>\n<p>Aaron Jorbin, a core contributor and fellow speaker (and, now a friend), found a CSS issue I could work on: bringing the alternate “blue” color scheme into sync with the default “grey” scheme. He helped me get set up, helped me through saving my changes as a patch, and then helped me submit that patch to Trac. Andy Nacin, another core contributor (and future friend!) subsequently committed that patch, and I received my first core props.</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/first-props2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2445" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/first-props2-1024x370.png" alt="Screenshot of ticket giving Mel props" width="960" height="347" /></a></p>\n<p>After creating my first patch, contributing became easier and easier. My confidence grew, and I spent more time participating in IRC, p2s, and Trac discussions. Then, in January of 2013, major design changes started coming to WordPress.</p>\n<h3>My WordPress apprenticeship</h3>\n<p>It started with icons.</p>\n<p>Ben Dunkle, WordPress’s official icon designer, proposed some shiny new icons for the WordPress dashboard. They were “flat” — one color, not a ton of details. The icons were awesome, but they didn’t really fit stylistically with the rest of the admin. The flat styles clashed with WordPress’ heavy use of gradients.</p>\n<p>So, I helped imagine what the admin could look like totally flat. We tried out a couple ideas, got them committed, and refined in code. The stark styles looked really fresh after years of gradients!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, flattening the admin unearthed a whole lot of other issues. There wasn’t enough time to flesh out the new design before the next version of WordPress launched, so the flat styles got reverted and tabled for another time.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon after, I received an email via my site’s contact form:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Name</strong>: Matt</em><br />\n<em><strong> Comment</strong>: Add me on Skype when you get a chance.</em></p>\n<p>I think my heart stopped when I realized I had been emailed by the co-founder of WordPress, Matt Mullenweg. Matt invited me to come join a group that would take a broader look at redesigning the admin (codenamed “MP6”). It meant a lot for someone as important as Matt to recognize my skills. I spent a lot of my early years as a designer plagued with self-doubt, and suddenly I had someone pointing at me, going “I believe in you!”</p>\n<p>I leapt at the chance.</p>\n<p>Our group worked together on Skype. We quickly scoped the goal of MP6 to only update CSS and a little bit of JS. I helped Ben make some new vector icons, gave feedback and critiqued design proposals, and made some design proposals of my own. It was an intimate group where we all felt free to safely share and critique each other’s work. The mentorship I received from more experienced WordPress designers was invaluable to my growth. Working with these veterans of WordPress really helped me to grow into my fledgling wings.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/23/mp6-3-8-proposal/">WordPress 3.8 shipped with the updated admin interface</a>, and I knew it was time to take my design career to a new level.</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/4-8-credits-smaller.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2446" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/4-8-credits-smaller-1024x895.jpg" alt="WordPress 4.8 Credits" width="960" height="839" /></a></p>\n<h3>Leaving the nest</h3>\n<p>I’d had my eye on Automattic, the makers of WordPress.com, the Jetpack plugin, and many other products, for most of my time contributing to WordPress. A couple of the designers I worked with on MP6 were Automattic designers, and it was an absolute joy to collaborate with them. At this point I’d spent so much of my career as either a lone designer, or in a competitive environment, that having a supportive, collaborative group of people helping me improve my work was a revelation.</p>\n<p>I desperately wanted to work at Automattic.</p>\n<p>While MP6 was in the works, I participated in a three month long design apprenticeship at a local agency. I worked alongside experienced mentors and fellow apprentices to hone my interface and user experience design skills. It was challenging and thrilling and totally complemented the mentorship I was receiving from WordPress folks. Plus, working in a positive environment reinforced my desire to work somewhere similar.</p>\n<p>After the apprenticeship, I finally felt like I had the skills and confidence to apply. I spent a lot of time writing my cover letter, and redesigning my portfolio to use in-depth case studies on a small number of recent projects. I finally sent off my application and crossed my fingers.</p>\n<p>A couple weeks later, I received a reply back asking to schedule an interview. I was terrified, but luckily, Automattic conducts interviews via text, so I was able to hide my fear behind my keyboard and hopefully try to project confidence. (Aside: I also show all my emotions on my face, so online communication is the best.)</p>\n<p>It must have worked, because I was moved on to the next phase of the application, doing a self-contained trial project, which was a whole ton of fun. I was able to put my recently refined research, interviewing, and user testing skills to use. I loved being given a real challenge to tackle. My trial went well, so I was moved along to the final interview with Matt Mullenweg. We spent a couple hours chatting on Skype, and at the end of our conversation I was given an offer. Welcome to Automattic!</p>\n<p>After working so hard on my apprenticeship, and on MP6, joining Automattic felt incredibly validating. The work I put in, the mentorship I received, all of the collaboration, led to this moment. I felt like I had graduated from apprentice and was now embarking on my adventure as a design journeyman. And boy, has it been an adventure!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/automattic-2-smaller.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2447" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/automattic-2-smaller-1024x678.jpg" alt="Automattic Group Photo" width="960" height="636" /></a></h3>\n<h3>Design leadership</h3>\n<p>The past four and a half years at Automattic have been fantastic. I have the best coworkers anyone can ask for. I’ve worked with some incredibly talented and empathetic designers, whose guidance and feedback constantly encourage me to improve my skills.</p>\n<p>I’ve continued to contribute to WordPress, slowly gaining more responsibility in the project the longer I stuck around. That’s the secret to becoming an open source leader, I discovered — <strong>decisions are made by the people who show up</strong>.</p>\n<p>In 2016, I was asked to by the Release Design Lead for <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/04/coleman/">WordPress 4.5 “Coleman.”</a> I worked alongside the other release leads to make design-related decisions that impacted the release. This was the first release we experimented with having a Design Lead. I felt like design finally had a seat at the table.</p>\n<p>This continued to be the case last year, when Matt Mullenweg announced core focuses for the year: Editing, Customization, and the API. Both Editing and Customization had designers co-leading their focus. I was named the Customization co-lead. I’d been working on customization and site building on WordPress.com for over a year, so I had relevant experience.</p>\n<p>I worked with my developer co-lead, Weston Ruter, on low-hanging fruit, most of which we released in WordPress 4.8. The release was smaller, focused more on improvements than new features. We made a lot of updates to widgets, which had been long neglected.</p>\n<p>After that, we turned our sights to some more ambitious projects: drafting and scheduling changes in the Customizer, improvements to code editing in the WordPress admin, even more widget updates, and upgrades around the flow of changing themes and building menus for your site. We took a design-first approach to building out these new features, and I think it really shows in the work that we produced during the 4.9 release cycle, which Weston and I co-led.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/11/tipton/">WordPress 4.9 “Tipton”</a> launched in November. Since then, I’ve pivoted to work on <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">Gutenberg</a>, the new editing experience for WordPress which should be released in 5.0. Once the editing experience wraps up, we’re going to start looking at how we can extend Gutenberg to cover site building and customization.

Alternatively, you can update by uploading the files via SFTP or by using WP-CLI.</p>\n<p>Dion Hulse, WordPress lead developer, says managed hosts that apply updates automatically for their customers will be able to update sites as they normally do. This may explain why some users have reported that sites running 4.9.3 have automatically updated to 4.9.4 without issue.</p>\n<p>The bug stems from an attempt to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43103">reduce the number of API calls</a> made when the auto update cron job is run. Unfortunately, the code committed had unintended consequences. &#8220;It triggers a fatal error as not all of the dependencies of <code>find_core_auto_update()</code> are met,&#8221; Hulse said.</p>\n<p>A postmortem will be published once the team determines how to prevent this mistake from happening in the future. &#8220;We don’t like bugs in WordPress any more than you do, and we’ll be taking steps to both increase automated coverage of our updates and improve tools to aid in the detection of similar bugs before they become an issue in the future,&#8221; Hulse said.</p>\n<p>While WordPress 4.9.3 and 4.9.4 do not include any security fixes, it&#8217;s important to note that in order to receive automatic security updates in the future, sites using the 4.9 branch must be running at least 4.9.4.

You can also use tools like <a href="https://local.getflywheel.com/">Local by Flywheel</a>, or <a href="https://www.mamp.info/">MAMP Pro</a> to run a local &#8220;dev&#8221; version of your site. These are great ways of testing code changes, playing with new plugins, or making theme tweaks, without risking breaking your live &#8220;production&#8221; site.</p>\n<p>Here is my advice for working with different WordPress environments.</p>\n<h2>Handling Credentials</h2>\n<p>The live (&#8220;production&#8221;) version of your site should be opt-in. That is, your site&#8217;s Git repo should <strong>not</strong> store production credentials in <strong>wp-config.php</strong>. You don&#8217;t want something to happen like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ez8ag/accidentally_destroyed_production_database_on/">when this developer accidentally connected to the production database</a> and destroyed all the company data on his first day.</p>\n<p>Instead of keeping database credentials in <strong>wp-config.php</strong>, have <strong>wp-config.php</strong> look for a <strong>local-config.php</strong> file. Replace the section that defines the database credentials with something like this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">if ( file_exists( __DIR__ . ''/local-config.php'' ) ) {\n    include( __DIR__ . ''/local-config.php'' );\n} else {\n    die( ''local-config.php not found'' );\n}</pre>\n<p>Make sure you add <strong>local-config.php</strong> to your <strong>.gitignore</strong> so that no one commits their local version to the repo.</p>\n<p>On production, you&#8217;ll create a <strong>local-config.php</strong> with production credentials. On staging or development environments, you&#8217;ll create a <strong>local-config.php</strong> with the credentials for those environments.</p>\n<h2>Production is a Choice</h2>\n<p>Right after the section that calls out <strong>local-config.php</strong>, put something like this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">if ( ! defined( ''WP_ENVIRONMENT'' ) ) {\n    define( ''WP_ENVIRONMENT'', ''development'' );\n}</pre>\n<p>The idea here is that there will always be a <strong>WP_ENVIRONMENT</strong> constant available to you that tells you what kind of environment your site is being run in. In production, you will put this in <strong>local-config.php</strong> along with the database credentials:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">define( ''WP_ENVIRONMENT'', ''production'' );</pre>\n<p>Now, in your theme, or your custom plugins, or other code, you can do things like this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">if ( ''production'' === WP_ENVIRONMENT ) {\n    add_filter( ''option_gravityformsaddon_gravityformsstripe_settings'', function( $stripe_settings ) {\n        $stripe_settings[''api_mode''] = ''live'';\n        return $stripe_settings;\n    });\n} else {\n    add_filter( ''option_gravityformsaddon_gravityformsstripe_settings'', function( $stripe_settings ) {\n        $stripe_settings[''api_mode''] = ''test'';\n        return $stripe_settings;\n    });\n}</pre>\n<p>This bit of code is for the Easy Digital Downloads Stripe gateway plugin. It makes sure that on the production environment, the payment gateway is always in <strong>live</strong> mode, and the anywhere else, it is always in <strong>test</strong> mode. This protects against two very bad situations: connecting to live services from a test environment (which could result in customers being charged for test transactions) and connecting to test services from a live environment (which could prevent customers from purchasing products on your site).</p>\n<p>You can also use this pattern to do things like hide Google Analytics on your test sites, or make sure debug plugins are only active on development sites (more on that, in a future post!)</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t rely on complicated procedures (&#8220;step 34: make sure you go into the Stripe settings and switch the site to test mode on your local test site&#8221;) — make these things explicit in code. Make it impossible to screw it up, and working on your sites will become faster and less stressful.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Do you need <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">WordPress services?</a></b></p>\n<p>Mark runs <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">Covered Web Services</a> which specializes in custom WordPress solutions with focuses on security, speed optimization, plugin development and customization, and complex migrations.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to start a conversation!</p>\n[contact-form]";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:59:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"Matt: National Magazine Award Nomination";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47900";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"https://ma.tt/2018/02/national-magazine-award-nomination/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:761:"<p>Longreads <a href="http://www.magazine.org/asme/about-asme/pressroom/asme-press-releases/ellies-2018-finalists-announced">was nominated today</a> for its first-ever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Magazine_Awards">National Magazine Award</a>, in the category of columns and commentary, alongside ESPN The Magazine, BuzzFeed News, Pitchfork, and New York magazine.

Cory Miller &#8212; CEO of iThemes &#8212; will be the Business Manager of the new unit, with iThemes COO Matt Danner as the Director of Technology and Operations for iThemes. The entire team of twenty three people is staying on, and will continue to be headquartered in Oklahoma.</p>\n<p>This is not the first or last time we&#8217;ll see longstanding WordPress companies get rolled into large hosting providers. It&#8217;s a trend that is natural in any ecosystem as it matures, and iThemes was a clear and quality candidate for a host to target. Cory said the culture around Liquid Web, including their &#8220;heroic support,&#8221; but also the quality he sees in their management team, was a key motivator for them to go work with Liquid Web.</p>\n<p>As hosting companies evolve more and more to provide broader services for customers with managed WordPress offerings, there is less room for utility product creators to fill that gap.</p>\n<p>Backups are a fine example: customers may see less need for external backups if they have confidence that their hosting is managing backups properly. Security is another. These have been great products for iThemes, and still are &#8212; but their current markets are more for hosts without a managed experience, and that slice of the pie has been narrowing.</p>\n<p>iThemes has had a partnership with Liquid Web for about a year and a half now, which started by licensing iThemes Sync for Liquid Web&#8217;s WordPress hosting offering. They&#8217;ve slowly been integrating more features into the platform, and the acquisition will allow Liquid Web to further integrate iThemes&#8217; offerings, and allow iThemes to improve some of their product offerings with the backing of Liquid&#8217;s Web&#8217;s hosting infrastructure.</p>\n<p>I spoke to Cory Miller about the move, which is occurring not long after iThemes&#8217; ten year anniversary in business. He said he looks back every year and sees them as chapters in the iThemes story, and this feels just the same. He&#8217;s excited about what the backing from Liquid Web will allow them to do, and most importantly for him, the ability to keep supporting the team they have built over the years.</p>\n<p>Cory tells me he&#8217;s amazed that they&#8217;ve been able to build the company they have built, and neither he nor his business partners would have imagined it ten years ago. All equity holders had their shares purchased by Liquid Web, and Cory and the team will be Liquid Web employees.</p>\n<p>iThemes has iterated on the business many times over the years &#8212; as the name implies. Their theme business slowly dwindled in terms of the overall ratio of sales revenue it provided. BackupBuddy has long been a flagship, and they&#8217;ve found great success the past couple of years since they acquired and iterated on the iThemes Security product. He said that it took them experimenting a great deal &#8212; and like Exchange for eCommerce, and others &#8212; it didn&#8217;t always work out the way they hoped. But because they stayed agile and kept working at it, they&#8217;ve consistently been able to grow and diversify their product line.</p>\n<p>One practical component Liquid Web will be able to provide, as an example, is their data centers to power BackupBuddy and iThemes Stash storage and processing. iThemes has historically used Amazon, which Cory said really adds up and has started to eat into their own margins. Liquid Web will help them not only improve the offering but also to be able to perform those functions more affordably.</p>\n<p>For Liquid Web, this acquisition furthers their goal to integrate WordPress-specific functionality into their suite of WordPress hosting tools. They recently launched WooCommerce hosting on their platform, and the iThemes Sales Accelerator product can now be a core component of that offering. Additionally, the technology iThemes has built with BackupBuddy and Sync will further add to their platform.</p>\n<p>Beyond the technology and products, Liquid Web Vice President of Products and Innovation Chris Lema tells me it&#8217;s about the team:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This adds so much to what we’re doing with managed WordPress and managed WooCommerce, that it just made a lot of sense — both from a product perspective, and even more from a team perspective.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Having spent a lot of time with the management teams for each of these companies, I would agree that the culture fit is a really good one. And for Liquid Web, a company continuing to make its big push into the WordPress market, it is a solid strategic acquisition move that offers product dividends but more importantly adds a great and experienced WordPress team to their company.</p>\n<p><a href="https://ithemes.com/2018/01/31/ithemes-joining-the-liquid-web-family/">Cory shares more</a> about the news on the iThemes blog.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:12:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"HeroPress: The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2431";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:158:"https://heropress.com/essays/journey-curiosity-challenge-transformation/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journey-curiosity-challenge-transformation";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9293:"<img width="960" height="480" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/013118-2-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: My place in the world has transformed." /><p>When I look back on the past five years I’ve been working with WordPress, I feel the real weight of the journey I’ve had to get where I am. Much of it has been filled with challenge of both of the difficult and welcome variety. I’m an optimist and problem-solver to the core, but I sometimes wonder how I got through these past years. One thing is for certain, my involvement with WordPress, the opportunities and community around it, has been a force for so much good, motivation, and satisfaction in my life.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>When I was introduced to WordPress, I was going through one of the most trying times of my adult life. My dad had suddenly passed away just a few years before. We didn’t have the best relationship, but his quirkiness, interest in esoteric things, and passion for food certainly rubbed off on me.</p>\n<p>I was living with roommates, but moved back home to be with my mom. Not too long after, she developed debilitating osteoarthritis in both of her hips. From a physically healthy yet grieving 52-year-old woman to eventually becoming handicap and walker-bound, needless to say, impacted our lives greatly. I became her caretaker, and I also worked retail part-time for the flexible schedule.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I felt emotionally exhausted, uninspired and quite lost with what my next steps would be.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I grew up using the internet fervently as a youth and in my college years. I met new friends, learned new skills, and traveled to new places thanks the endless source of information it provided for my active mind. So when a friend, now my mentor, John Bolyard, approached me to help him in his web marketing and development consultancy using “WordPress” I just said “yes.” It was mysterious, being unknown to me, and intriguing, which is usually a green light in my book!</p>\n<p>I started doing administrative work on a website he helped develop for a national guild. Like many situations, he had finished their website and they would circle back to him for minor updates. I took on the minor updates, started tinkering on my own, and fell in love in the process.</p>\n<p>The accessibility with which one could make changes and produce content dynamically was just mind blowing to me. It was my gateway to web development and now I could make web content with the ability to work with code, if I so chose. It seemed an endless source of learning and knowledge- it was a great fit.</p>\n<h2>Levelling Up</h2>\n<p>That went well and he brought me on a larger project to help the artist, Dorothy Braudy, create her website archive. I was able to blend my affinity for the technical and handy visual memory to help an all around amazing person (she&#8217;s still one of closest people in my life) tell her story through her art. I was thrilled to have the challenge and the privilege to bring her vibrant and prolific work (hundreds of pieces) to the web.</p>\n<p>I also started assisting John with teaching WordPress classes at SCORE, a government organization that helps people develop and sustain small businesses.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We volunteered our time teaching business owners WordPress to help them build their own websites.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was challenging yet rewarding to see them feel empowered that they could take a hands-on role in making their web presence.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I ended up with several clients and that’s how my freelancing career began :). I also started going to meetups. John brought me to my first one in the San Fernando Valley. I was like wait&#8230;this software is cool and people gather to talk about it? I can also learn stuff too?! Get outta town!</p>\n<p>Well, I started attending fairly frequently. Particularly, the meetup in the West Valley lead by Andrew Behla (then at the Topanga Canyon Library). I soaked up info from presentations given by Roy Sivan, Suzette Franck, and Lucy Beer (who is now my teammate). Just to name a few ;).</p>\n<p>After building a consistent client base, I also started working part-time as a project assistant at a boutique museum exhibit development firm. My first project was for the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens supporting the development of an educational WordPress website for their Junípero Serra exhibition. What were the chances? My skills in WordPress proved helpful for the project and the firm&#8217;s website.</p>\n<h2>Pivoting</h2>\n<p>At this point, I had seen my mom through her first hip replacement and recovery, and she was moving on to her next one. I thought about where I saw myself and also where I could build a sustainable future given the circumstances. I thought WordPress, and so I did a trial as a Happiness Engineer at WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>While I didn&#8217;t get the position, I met some great people and learned exponentially more in that short time than I had on my own. More so, I learned about the users, WordPress’ strengths and weaknesses, and how to fill that gap in an accessible way. I was sad, but also motivated. I took on more client work and just did the thing.</p>\n<p>After three years, it was time to leave the exhibit development firm. It was fascinating, it provided me a design, development and project management vocabulary I had never encountered before. However, I needed a firmer career path and I still thought WordPress. My mom was recovered, I had also just recovered from some health issues, and I knew it was time for a change.</p>\n<p>While doing client work for several months, I also explored options on how I could &#8220;level up.&#8221; Maybe it was my time to dig into web development: should I learn on my own, go to a school?</p>\n<blockquote><p>In my gut, I knew I had to find work that supported my endeavors, so I started applying in the WordPress and tech ecosystem.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I networked, attended workshops, and met some awesome folks in the local tech and WordPress communities. I was also approached about joining the organizer team for WordCamp Los Angeles (WCLAX). I said “yes” (that magic word) and last year we had a great event.</p>\n<p>When we started planning, I had also heard from WP Media, (the company behind the WP Rocket and Imagify plugins), that I was hired for their Customer Support position. We’re a remote crew spread across 8 countries. However, I’ve been lucky enough to spend time with them at WordCamp Europe, WordCamp US, and our annual retreat last year.</p>\n<h2>Transformation</h2>\n<p>My place in the world has transformed. I&#8217;ve traveled to places once out of reach, work every day with some of the most brilliant and kind people in the WordPress space, and grow day by day with new challenges and opportunities. I&#8217;m happy, mom is healthy, and the journey continues…</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Journey%3A%20Curiosity%2C%20Challenge%2C%20Transformation&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fjourney-curiosity-challenge-transformation%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fjourney-curiosity-challenge-transformation%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fjourney-curiosity-challenge-transformation%2F&title=The+Journey%3A+Curiosity%2C+Challenge%2C+Transformation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/journey-curiosity-challenge-transformation/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/013118-2-150x150.jpg&description=The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/journey-curiosity-challenge-transformation/" title="The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/journey-curiosity-challenge-transformation/">The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 11:00:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Renee Johnson";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"WPTavern: WooCommerce 3.3 Increases Theme Compatibility, Auto Regenerates Thumbnails";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=77795";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-3-increases-theme-compatibility-auto-regenerates-thumbnails";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3108:"<p>WooCommerce 3.3 <a href="https://woocommerce.com/2018/01/whats-new-woocommerce-3-3/">is available</a> and is considered a minor release. Based on the project’s <a href="https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/Roadmap-and-release-process">new release process</a>, it should be fully backwards compatible with previous releases up to 3.0.</p>\n<p>The orders screen has been redesigned with large buttons that indicate an order’s status.

In 3.3, improvements have been made so that WooCommerce renders on themes that don’t fully support it, making it compatible with nearly every WordPress theme.</p>\n<p>Users can now set the number of columns and rows for shops with the ability to preview the results live via the Customizer. The columns will resize to fill the entire width of the area and is available on all themes.</p>\n<p>In earlier versions of WooCommerce, shop owners needed to use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/">Regenerate Thumbnails</a> after updating a product’s image as WordPress did not automatically resize the image and generate new thumbnails. WooCommerce 3.3 adds on-the-fly thumbnail regeneration and background thumbnail resizing.</p>\n<p>In addition, users can customize the aspect ratios of product images. The choices are classic square images, custom cropped images, or uncropped images</p>\n<img class="aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/WC33ImageAspectRatio.png?w=627&ssl=1" alt="" width="627" height="402" />WooCommerce 3.3 Image Aspect Ratio Options\n<p>Shop owners can now view logs of product downloads with a couple of built-in filters including, by order, by product, by customer, and by file. You can also search for extensions now from the Extensions administration screen.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce 3.3 includes more features and changes than what’s listed here.

There are a few ways to do this, but the simplest way is to just make your site root a Git checkout of your site files.</p>\n<p>Then, if your server has read-access to your Git remote, you can run some Git commands to sync everything. Here are your options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>git pull</strong> — Simple, but might fail if someone naughty has made code modifications on the server.</li>\n<li><strong>git fetch &amp;&amp; git reset &#8211;hard origin/master</strong> — The hard reset method will wipe any local modifications that someone has mistakenly made.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But wait. Before you implement this, it is very important that you ensure that your server&#8217;s <strong>.git</strong> directory is not readable, as it might be able to leak sensitive information about your site&#8217;s code. How you do this will depend on what web server you&#8217;re running. In Nginx, I do the following:</p>\n<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">location ~ /\\.(ht[a-z]+|git|svn) {\ndeny all;\n}</pre>\n<p>In Apache, you could put the following in your <strong>.htaccess</strong> file:</p>\n<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">RedirectMatch 404 /\\.git</pre>\n<p>SSHing into your server every time is tedious, so let&#8217;s script that:</p>\n<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">#!/bin/bash\nssh example.com ''cd /srv/www/example.com &amp;&amp; git pull''</pre>\n<p>Save that to <strong>deploy.sh</strong> in your Git repo, run <strong>chmod +x deploy.sh</strong>, and commit it to the repo. Now when you&#8217;re ready to deploy the site, just type <strong>./deploy.sh</strong> and the public site will pull down the latest changes from your main Git remote.</p>\n<p>Bonus points if you make <strong>deploy.sh</strong> take an optional commit hash, so you can also use this tool to roll back to a previous hash, in case a commit goes wrong.</p>\n<p>This method has served me well, for years, and has required no maintenance.</p>\n<p>What methods are you using for WordPress code deploys?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Do you need <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">WordPress services?</a></b></p>\n<p>Mark runs <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">Covered Web Services</a> which specializes in custom WordPress solutions with focuses on security, speed optimization, plugin development and customization, and complex migrations.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to start a conversation!</p>\n[contact-form]";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 15:31:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"WPTavern: UpdraftPlus Acquires Easy Updates Manager Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=77700";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"https://wptavern.com/updraftplus-acquires-easy-updates-manager-plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2048:"<p><a href="https://updraftplus.com/">UpdraftPlus</a>, a popular WordPress backup plugin actively installed on more than 1 million sites has acquired the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/stops-core-theme-and-plugin-updates/">Easy Updates Manager</a> plugin for an undisclosed amount.</p>\n<p>Easy Updates Manager disables core, theme, and plugin updates in WordPress and provides granular control over them.

Post Status Draft is hosted by Brian Krogsgard and co-host Brian Richards.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Brian and Brian discuss market segmentation across the WordPress ecosystem. The focus for this discussion focused entirely on the entry-level segment of site assemblers and their small-business clients as well as the mid-level market of contractors and agencies selling additional levels of service. The duo talked through a few different strategies employed in each segment, including service differentiation, regional focus, building a network of complementary contractors, systemizing processes, delivering quality customer support flow, and selling ongoing service.</p>\n<p>In addition to this look at market segmentation, the Brians shared a few useful resources for both Gutenberg and WP-CLI.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mike McAlister&#8217;s <a href="http://gutenberg.news/">Gutenberg News</a></li>\n<li>Ahmed Awais&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block">create-gutenberg-block</a></li>\n<li>Delicious Brain&#8217;s <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/wordpress-cli-packages-review/">WP-CLI packages reviews</a></li>\n<li>WordPress Website: <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-website-cost/">How much should it cost?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wpsessions.com/sessions/selling-ongoing-service/">Selling Ongoing Services with Sara Dunn</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sponsor: iThemes</h3>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by <a href="https://ithemes.com/?utm_source=post_status&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=ps_ads">iThemes</a>.

Unfortunately it introduced a bug that prevented many sites from automatically updating to future releases. To remedy this issue, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordpress-4-9-4-maintenance-release/">version 4.9.4 was released</a> the following day requiring many people to manually update their sites.</p>\n\n<p>While this kind of issue is always regrettable, the good thing is that it was fixed quickly, and that not all sites had updated to 4.9.3 yet, which meant they bypassed the bug in that version.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more technical information about this issue <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/06/wordpress-4-9-4-release-the-technical-details/">on the Core development blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The WordCamp Incubator is Back</h2>\n\n<p>In 2016, the Global Community Team ran an experimental program to help spread WordPress to underserved areas by providing more significant organizing support for their first WordCamp event. This program was dubbed the WordCamp Incubator, and it was so successful in the three cities where it ran that <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordcamp-incubator-2-0/">the program is back for 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the Community Team is looking for cities to be a part of this year’s incubator by <a href="https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-city-application">taking applications</a>. Additionally, each incubator community will need an experienced WordCamp organizer to assist them as a co-lead organizer for their event — if that sounds interesting to you, then you can <a href="https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-co-lead-application">fill in the application form for co-leads</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out further information about the WordCamp Incubator <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/19/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-announcement/">on the Community Team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordPress Meetup Roundtables scheduled for March</h2>\n\n<p>In order to assist local WordPress meetup organizers with running their meetup groups, some members of the Community Team have organized <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/23/wordpress-meetup-roundtables-scheduled-for-march/">weekly meetup roundtable discussions through the month of March</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These will be run as video chats at 16:00 UTC every Wednesday this month and will be a great place for meetup organizers to come together and help each other out with practical ideas and advice.</p>\n\n<p>If you are not already in the WordPress meetup program and would like to join, you can find out more information in <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/">the WordPress Meetup Organizer Handbook</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>GDPR Compliance in WordPress Core</h2>\n\n<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an upcoming regulation that will affect all online services across Europe. In order to prepare for this, a working group has been formed to make sure that WordPress is compliant with the GDPR regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the fact that this will be a requirement for the project going forward, it will also have an important and significant impact on the privacy and security of WordPress as a whole. The working group has posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/19/proposed-roadmap-tools-for-gdpr-compliance/">their proposed roadmap</a> for this project and it looks very promising.</p>\n\n<p>To get involved in building WordPress Core, jump into the #gdpr-compliance channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>WPShout published <a href="https://wpshout.com/complete-guide-wordpress-security/">a thorough guide to WordPress security</a>.</li>\n    <li>The Community Team has published interesting statistics from the WordCamp program in <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/27/wordcamps-in-2016/">2016</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/28/wordcamps-in-2017/">2017</a>.</li>\n    <li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/15/potential-addition-of-a-new-onboarding-team/">An intriguing proposal has been made</a> for a new ‘Onboarding’ team to be started in the WordPress project.</li>\n    <li>The new editing experience for WordPress, named Gutenberg, continues to be actively developed with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/16/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16th-february/">a feature-packed release</a> this past month.</li>\n    <li>The Advanced WordPress Facebook group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vS_jR5-nIo">held an interview with WordPress co-founder, Matt Mullenweg</a> about the Gutenberg project.</li>\n    <li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2018/02/27/two-factor-authentication-on-wp-org/">Two factor authentication is on its way to the WordPress.org network</a> — this will be a great improvement to the overall security of the project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"5613";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:39:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"WordCamp Incubator 2.0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordcamp-incubator-2-0/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 22:53:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Events";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"WordCamp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=5577";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:343:"WordCamps are informal, community-organized events that are put together by a team of local WordPress users who have a passion for growing their communities.

All three of these WordCamp incubators <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/30/wordcamp-incubator-report/">were a great success</a>, so we&#x27;re bringing the incubator program back for 2018.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Where should the next WordCamp incubators be? If you have always wanted a WordCamp in your city but haven’t been able to get a community started, this is a great opportunity. We will be taking applications for the next few weeks, then will get in touch with everyone who applied to discuss the possibilities.

You can apply to nominate your city even if you don’t want to be the main organizer, but for this to work well we will need local liaisons and volunteers, so please only nominate cities where you live or work so that we have at least one local connection to begin.<br /></p>\n\n<p>We&#x27;re looking forward to hearing from you!<br /></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"5577";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:36:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"WordPress 4.9.4 Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordpress-4-9-4-maintenance-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 Feb 2018 16:17:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"4.9";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=5559";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:350:"WordPress 4.9.4 is now available.

In the case of the questions &#8220;What is the best thing about WordPress?&#8221; and &#8220;What is the most frustrating thing about WordPress?&#8221; we listed the five most common responses, aggregated when applicable. In the case of the question “What is your gender?” in the 2016 and 2017 surveys, we aggregated responses as best we could. Responses meant to obscure respondents’ gender entirely are aggregated in “prefer not to answer.”</small></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"5310";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"The Month in WordPress: November 2017";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/12/the-month-in-wordpress-november-2017/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 01 Dec 2017 11:00:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"Month in WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=5290";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:354:"The WordPress project recently released WordPress 4.9, “Tipton” — a new major release named in honor of musician and band leader Billy Tipton.
